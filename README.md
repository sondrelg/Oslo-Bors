# Oslo-Bors
Oslo BÃ¸rs - Data collection and adaptation

This is my first attempt at sharing code on Github. The code is not very elegant, and perhaps not very useful for most. Mostly, it is an attempt at sharing code I write as a part of a tutorials series.

Most code is an attempt at adaptation for the Norwegian stock market, of the pythonprogramming.net code covered in their tutorials: https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/
