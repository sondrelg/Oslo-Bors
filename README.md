# Oslo-Bors
Oslo BÃ¸rs - Data collection and data adaptation.

This is my first attempt at sharing code on Github. My code is generally pretty ugly, and perhaps not very useful to most. The code is mostly just an adaptation of a tutorial series' code to the Norwegian stock exchange. Full credit goes to the creator of 'pythonprogramming.net' for the code covered in his tutorials: https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/.

However, if this does interest you, this is what I aim to cover:
1. Downloading market data from all Norwegian stocks
2. Combining said data to a single dataframe
3. Different applications of the data for valuation and analysis purposes.
