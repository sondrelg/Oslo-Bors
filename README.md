# Oslo-Bors
Oslo BÃ¸rs - Data collection and data adaptation.

This is my first attempt at sharing code on Github. My code is generally pretty basic, and perhaps not very useful. The code is mostly just an adaptation of an online tutorial, adapted to the Norwegian stock exchange. See link for the tutorial: https://pythonprogramming.net/getting-stock-prices-python-programming-for-finance/.

However, if this does interest you, this is what it does:
1. Downloads market data from all Norwegian stocks, using the Yahoo Finance API,
2. Combines said data to a single dataframe, &
3. Creates a covariance- & correlation-matrix

Again, please note that this is simply a small project I'm doing to learn how to code.
